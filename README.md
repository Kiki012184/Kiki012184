## Introduction!
___
Hi! I'm **Enggar Rizki Maulana**, better known as **Kiki**. I'm a content creator in several games, and a self-taught programmer. My content is mostly open source on GitHub, and I've been creating content since 2018.


I play games where my content has been created, tooâ€”and I'm also known as an Indonesian translator on several games voluntarily.


Besides that, I like to learn new languages and create content in my spare time! For now, I live in Banyuwangi, East Java, Indonesia.
