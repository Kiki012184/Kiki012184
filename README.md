**About Me!**


Hey there! It's Kiki, a simple high school student from Indonesia. When I'm not in class, you can find me gaming or programming - it's my escape from harsh reality. <br />

Did I mention that my favorite animal is a fox and my all-time favorite anime is "No game no life"? It's all about living life to the fullest and having fun.<br />
